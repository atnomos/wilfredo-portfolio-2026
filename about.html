        <p>
          I photograph people the way you remember them — not posed, not performed, but present.
          My portraits are quiet studies in character: the weight behind a uniform, the calm before
          a performance, the warmth in someone who has spent their career in service to others.
        </p>
        <p>
          My path to photography runs through design and storytelling. A BFA from the Academy of
          Art University gave me the compositional foundation; years as a Creative Trainer at Apple
          sharpened my eye for what makes a moment connect. Today I work as a Technical Program
          Manager at Disney, where I think every day about how stories move people — and I bring
          that same intentionality to every portrait I make.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe a great portrait is a collaboration. My background in design and program
          management means I come to every shoot with both a clear visual vision and the structure
          to put people at ease — so the person in front of the lens can let go and simply
          be themselves. That's the moment I'm after.
