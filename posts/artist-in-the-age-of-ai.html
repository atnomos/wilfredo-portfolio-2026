      <p>
        I've been using Claude Code — Anthropic's AI — to build this very website. Not to generate
        art. Not to replace a creative decision. To write the infrastructure that lets me show
        my work to the world. And somewhere in that process, a question kept surfacing: does
        this make me less of an artist?
      </p>

      <p>
        The short answer is no. The longer answer is worth sitting with.
      </p>

      <h2>The fear is old. The tools are new.</h2>

      <p>
        Every generation of artists has faced a version of this. The darkroom photographer
        who watched Photoshop arrive. The illustrator who watched stock photo libraries
        explode. The designer who watched Canva democratize layouts they spent years
        learning. Each time, the fear was the same: <em>if the barrier drops, does the craft?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        It doesn't. What drops is the friction. What remains — what has always remained —
        is judgment. Knowing what to make. Knowing when it's done. Knowing the difference
        between a frame that works and one that almost works.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The tool never had taste. That was always yours.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>What Claude Code actually does</h2>

      <p>
        When I work with Claude Code, I'm not describing a vague feeling and waiting for
        something magical to appear. I'm directing. I know what I want — the layout, the
        typography scale, the animation curve, the exact feeling of a page. The AI writes
        the CSS. I decide whether it's right.
      </p>

      <p>
        That distinction matters enormously. The output is only as considered as the person
        asking for it. Vague input produces generic output. Specific, opinionated input —
        rooted in years of looking at good work and bad work — produces something worth
        keeping. The artist's eye doesn't get outsourced. It gets applied upstream.
      </p>

      <h2>Moving pixels was never the point</h2>

      <p>
        Here's what I think a lot of creatives miss when they feel threatened by AI: they
        conflate the mechanics of their craft with the craft itself. But portrait photography
        was never about the chemical reaction in a darkroom. It was about what you saw when
        you looked at a person. The darkroom was just how you made that visible.
      </p>

      <p>
        The same logic holds now. Building a website was never about writing CSS by hand.
        It was about having a considered visual language — a point of view about space,
        weight, motion — and making that exist in a browser. Claude writes the CSS. I bring
        the point of view.
      </p>

      <p>
        If anything, the experience has sharpened my thinking. When you can't blame the
        tool for a bad result — when execution is fast and cheap — you run out of excuses.
        You're left with your taste, naked. Either you know what good looks like or you don't.
      </p>

      <h2>Good taste is still rare</h2>

      <p>
        This is the part I want to say clearly: AI does not produce taste. It produces
        volume. It can generate a thousand layouts, a thousand color combinations, a thousand
        headlines — and without someone in the room who knows which one is right, all you
        have is noise with good resolution.
      </p>

      <p>
        The work of an artist in 2026 is curation. Direction. The willingness to say
        <em>not that, this.</em> To reject nine options and know why. To push for the tenth
        that doesn't exist yet. That capacity is not compressible. It comes from years of
        looking carefully at the world and caring about what you see.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <p>
        So if you're a creative sitting with anxiety about what AI means for your work —
        I get it. The ground is moving. But the thing that makes you an artist isn't
        which tools you use. It's whether you have something to say and the judgment to
        say it well. That part hasn't been automated. And I don't think it will be.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keep making things. Just don't confuse the brush with the painter.
      </p>
