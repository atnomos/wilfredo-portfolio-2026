      <p>
        There's a moment, maybe two seconds before you press the shutter, where everything
        either collapses or opens up. The subject shifts their weight. Their eyes change.
        Something — call it presence, call it trust — either arrives or it doesn't. That
        moment is what portrait photography is actually about.
      </p>

      <p>
        The camera is the least interesting part of the equation. It records. It doesn't
        perceive. Perception is yours to bring, and it starts long before you raise the
        viewfinder to your eye.
      </p>

      <h2>Before the shutter: the conversation</h2>

      <p>
        Every session I do begins with talking — not about logistics, but about the person.
        What are they proud of? What are they afraid the camera will reveal? Most people walk
        in carrying a story about what they look like in photos, and it's almost always a
        bad one. Your first job is to dissolve it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I ask about their day. Their commute. Whatever is immediately true. Small specifics
        ground people. They stop performing "subject" and start being themselves. That's
        when the session actually begins.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The best portrait is a collaboration between two people who both decide to be present
        at the same moment.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Light as language</h2>

      <p>
        Hard light is honest. Soft light is kind. Neither is better — they're different
        conversations. Hard light reveals structure: the bones under the face, the texture
        of a lifetime. Soft light suggests interiority, warmth, the version of someone their
        closest friends know.
      </p>

      <p>
        I try to choose light based on who the person is, not on what looks technically
        correct. A musician I photographed last year needed hard directional window light —
        she was sharp-minded, precise, a little guarded. The shadows told more truth than
        the highlights. An actor I photographed the week before needed soft wraparound
        light. His whole instrument is openness. The light had to match.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <h2>The moment you almost miss</h2>

      <p>
        The shot I've learned to watch for is the one that happens between the shots. When
        someone relaxes after what they think was the "real" take. When they laugh at
        something I say that wasn't that funny. When they look away and then look back.
      </p>

      <p>
        I keep the camera up for that. The formal portraits are useful. But the ones that
        land — the ones people put on walls, that feel like someone finally got it — come
        from the in-between.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <p>
        If you're a photographer reading this: slow down. The technical stuff is learnable.
        Seeing people — really seeing them, before the lens is involved — that's the work.
        It doesn't show up in camera settings. It shows up in the photograph.
      </p>
